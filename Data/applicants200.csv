My mother taught me the value of hard work and the importance of taking care of others who cannot take care of themselves. She also stressed the importance of education to us, teaching us that it would help us access an easier life. Her encouragement along with my own determination helped me earn some of the best grades in my high school class."

During this time, I was involved in many aspects of animal care, including training our dogs, grooming our horses and milking cows. I loved spending time with our animals and discovered how wonderful their companionship can be. I also learned the importance of the less glamorous sides of animal care, including cleaning waste and pens to keep our creatures comfortable."
