    'I hope to become a web designer, so I would like to learn more about multimedia design. I feel your course would help me understand the digital design process and the way websites and their visual imagery can help businesses present images to consumers.', 
    'I love the way different colors and images can evoke emotions in viewers. I enjoy experimenting with the power of color and imagery and think I have a natural creative flair. I am confident that I will be able to apply this flair to new projects and increase my design abilities at your school.', 
    'I respect Seattle Universitys reputation for academic and sporting excellence. I appreciate that yours is a school that encourages students to achieve their potential both inside and outside the classroom. As a social person who has participated in several extracurricular activities, including the school band and softball team, I feel my diverse interests would make me a great fit for your school.', 
    'Studying at your school would help me develop my aptitude for design while having fun, whether it is on the sporting field or in another arena. I am open to whatever experiences life at Seattle University would bring me and hope I could achieve them through your multimedia design and communication degree. Thank you very much for considering my request', 
    'I grew up in a lower-income family with a single mother who worked three jobs to provide for my brothers and me. My mother taught me the value of hard work and the importance of taking care of others who cannot take care of themselves. She also stressed the importance of education to us, teaching us that it would help us access an easier life. Her encouragement along with my own determination helped me earn some of the best grades in my high school class.', 
    'As my mother worked long hours, I spent a lot of time caring for my youngest brother who has cerebral palsy. I feel the time I spent caring for him sparked an interest in nursing. I learned to be compassionate and patient and was rewarded by his smiles. I hope to make my own patients smile in the face of their own health concerns in the future.',
    'I feel my natural work ethic and drive to succeed would make me an asset to Los Angeles University. I know your school has an excellent nursing program, and feel it would give me the perfect environment to gain the degree I need to secure my dream job and give back to the community. Rest assured that I would make the most of the scholarship opportunity and make you and my mother proud.', 
    'I grew up around animals living on a farm in rural Wyoming. During this time, I was involved in many aspects of animal care, including training our dogs, grooming our horses and milking cows. I loved spending time with our animals and discovered how wonderful their companionship can be. I also learned the importance of the less glamorous sides of animal care, including cleaning waste and pens to keep our creatures comfortable.', 
    'Through my veterinary science studies, I have learned even more about animal care, including how to diagnose and treat animal diseases and how to help animals give birth. I believe these skills, along with the experience I acquired on the farm, would be invaluable to you at All Paws Animal Shelter. I also believe I could learn a lot more to complement my schooling at your organization.', 
    'I am especially interested in working at All Paws Animal Shelter as you accept a diverse range of animals. I also appreciate your shelters no-kill policy and commitment to ongoing care for senior animals. These policies align with my own belief that all animals deserve the chance to live a long life and find a forever home, no matter how long that takes.'
